## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting diabetes using patient health metrics. The project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in healthcare, showcasing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Preprocessing of input health metrics data.
- Implementation of a diabetes prediction model using supervised learning.
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
- Visualization of data and model performance using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## Dataset
The model uses the `diabetes.csv` dataset, which contains health metrics like glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and more. Ensure you have access to this dataset before running the project. If the dataset is proprietary, please obtain it from the appropriate source.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction-model.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd diabetes-prediction-model

# Install the required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset (`diabetes.csv`) into the project directory.
2. Open and execute the `main.ipynb` notebook.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Results
The model achieves satisfactory results in predicting diabetes. Detailed performance metrics and visualizations are included in the notebook.

## Technologies Used
- **Python Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `numpy` for numerical operations.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn` for preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation.
